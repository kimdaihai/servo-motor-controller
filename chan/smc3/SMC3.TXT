 o Controlled in Serial Command via UART
   - Direct Access to Position Command Register
   - G0/G1 Motion Generation
 o Three Control Modes
   - Absolute Positioning Mode
   - Constant Speed Mode
   - Constant Torque Mode
 o Software Decoding of Quadrature Encoder Input
   - Count rate over 100,000 counts/sec in quadrature decoding
   - No External Component Required
 o Two PWM Outputs for H-bridge Driver
 o Three Diagnostic Outputs
   - Ready, Torque Limit and Servo Error
 o On-the-Fly Servo Tuning


Changes from SMC to SMC3

 o Removed Pulsed Input
 o Added Diagnostic Outputs
   - Ready: Servo control is running.
   - Torque Limit: Torque limit indicator for mode 2/3.
   - Servo Error: Servo error occured and enterd to mode 0. M command or
